                <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
                <p>Most of my professional experience comes from 
                    customer support and tech support. The majority in tech 
                    support regarding internet and phone. My latest job I 
                    worked as a support technician where I responded to 
                    customer emails regarding their cellphone questions, whether
                    it was technical issues or questions about their payments.</p>
                <p>I was also assigned customer chat sessions where they would ask 
                   questions in real time and you had to be quick in diagnosing problems.
                   Lastly I had access to a lot of backend systems to check what issues
                   a customer might have.
